# SearchEngineTest
Solution that compares keyWords to know wich one have more results in the search engines.
The exe file that must be used is: SearchEngineTest\ResultsCompare\bin\Debug\ResultsCompare.exe 
 for example: 
    C:\> ResultsCompare.exe java "transact sql" python
It receives as many arguments as provided. There is also a Windows project that I used to start the code and it 
works with two keywords entered.
